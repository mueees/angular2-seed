http://blog.thoughtram.io/angular/2016/02/22/angular-2-change-detection-explained.html
- each component has own 'change detection'
- change detection is also always performed from top to bottom for every single component,
every single time, starting from the root component

16. How to optimize 'change detection'
Answer: use 'changeDetection': ChangeDetectionStrategy.onPush property for the component, it will compare
object only by reference

    - parent has changeDetection property
    - child does not have
    - when child component change property it triggers 'detection' mechanism also in parent component
